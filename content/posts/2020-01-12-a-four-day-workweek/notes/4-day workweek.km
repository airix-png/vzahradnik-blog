SOCIALISTI.SK HO MAJÚ OD ZAČIATKU V PROGRAME.\n\nMédiá často riešia vek, pohlavie alebo rodinu momentálne najmladšej líderky na svete, 34-ročnej fínskej premiérky Sanny Marinovej, ktorá má navyše sotva dvojročné dieťa. Takmer vôbec sa však nezaoberajú tým, že táto mladá ambiciózna politička nie je žiadny marketingový produkt a vo voľbách zvíťazila s jasným sociálno-demokratickým programom, ako posunúť svoju krajinu vpred. Tým hlavným bodom je zaviesť 4-dňový pracovný týždeň a 6-hodinový pracovný deň.\n\nSocialisti.sk majú tento ambiciózny cieľ vo svojom politickom programe a volebných prioritách od začiatku. Pripomínam to preto, lebo prepytujem sociálnodemokratický Smer-SD skracovanie pracovného času odmietol (čo pri ich sociálnom konzervativizme vôbec neprekvapuje) a lídri Progresívneho Slovenska, ktorí sa nadchýnajú Sannou Marinovou ako vzorom pokroku, posmešne nazývajú naše riešenia komunistickými. Takže čo vlastne na ľavicovej političke obdivujú? Že je žena a že je mladá? U iných by nazvali takéto uvažovanie sexistickým.\n\nSkracovanie pracovného času nie je len systémovou odpoveďou na robotizáciu a hrozbu straty masívneho počtu pracovných miest, ale aj klasickou civilizačnou a mravnou témou pokrokovej ľavice. Na začiatku 20. storočia robotníci v Uhorsku dreli až 16 hodín denne bez nároku na zdravotnú starostlivosť, dovolenku či sociálne zabezpečenie. Pravica argumentovala proti skracovaniu pracovného času navlas rovnako ako dnes - že by to ekonomika neuniesla. O pár rokov neskôr sa 8-hodinový pracovný čas stal realitou v novej prosperujúcej republike. Rovnako ako 8-hodinový pracovný deň v roku 1918, aj 5-dňový pracovný týždeň v roku 1968 vybojovala ľavica. Podľa toho ju poznáte. Nie podľa neoliberálnych a ultrakonzervatívnych zástupných tém, ale podľa socialistických riešení, ktoré systematicky zlepšujú život pracujúceho človeka. Zamestnanec v 21. storočí si zaslúži viac voľného času pre rodinu, záľuby a vzdelávanie, skrátka pre kvalitnejší život. Firmy na to majú, ale nechcú sa svojich výsad vzdať. Pracujúci však majú nárok na viac. Práve pre takých vzniklo hnutie Socialisti.sk. Téma skracovania pracovného času sa stáva kľúčovou témou autentickej ľavice všade v Európe. Staňte sa súčasťou hnutia, ktoré znamená budúcnosť.\n\n\nPostoj.sk:\nhttps://www.postoj.sk/50492/mlada-zena-kojaca-dieta-jednoducho-idealna-premierka"},"children":[]},{"data":{"id":"bzqpnntux24g","created":1578517228535,"text":"Not in the Finnish government program.
