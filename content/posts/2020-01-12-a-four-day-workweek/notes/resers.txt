FÍNSKA ĽAVICA VYHRALA SO 4-DŇOVÝM PRACOVNÝM TÝŽDŇOM VOĽBY. SOCIALISTI.SK HO MAJÚ OD ZAČIATKU V PROGRAME.

Médiá často riešia vek, pohlavie alebo rodinu momentálne najmladšej líderky na svete, 34-ročnej fínskej premiérky Sanny Marinovej, ktorá má navyše sotva dvojročné dieťa. Takmer vôbec sa však nezaoberajú tým, že táto mladá ambiciózna politička nie je žiadny marketingový produkt a vo voľbách zvíťazila s jasným sociálno-demokratickým programom, ako posunúť svoju krajinu vpred. Tým hlavným bodom je zaviesť 4-dňový pracovný týždeň a 6-hodinový pracovný deň.

Socialisti.sk majú tento ambiciózny cieľ vo svojom politickom programe a volebných prioritách od začiatku. Pripomínam to preto, lebo prepytujem sociálnodemokratický Smer-SD skracovanie pracovného času odmietol (čo pri ich sociálnom konzervativizme vôbec neprekvapuje) a lídri Progresívneho Slovenska, ktorí sa nadchýnajú Sannou Marinovou ako vzorom pokroku, posmešne nazývajú naše riešenia komunistickými. Takže čo vlastne na ľavicovej političke obdivujú? Že je žena a že je mladá? U iných by nazvali takéto uvažovanie sexistickým.

Skracovanie pracovného času nie je len systémovou odpoveďou na robotizáciu a hrozbu straty masívneho počtu pracovných miest, ale aj klasickou civilizačnou a mravnou témou pokrokovej ľavice. Na začiatku 20. storočia robotníci v Uhorsku dreli až 16 hodín denne bez nároku na zdravotnú starostlivosť, dovolenku či sociálne zabezpečenie. Pravica argumentovala proti skracovaniu pracovného času navlas rovnako ako dnes - že by to ekonomika neuniesla. O pár rokov neskôr sa 8-hodinový pracovný čas stal realitou v novej prosperujúcej republike. Rovnako ako 8-hodinový pracovný deň v roku 1918, aj 5-dňový pracovný týždeň v roku 1968 vybojovala ľavica. Podľa toho ju poznáte. Nie podľa neoliberálnych a ultrakonzervatívnych zástupných tém, ale podľa socialistických riešení, ktoré systematicky zlepšujú život pracujúceho človeka. Zamestnanec v 21. storočí si zaslúži viac voľného času pre rodinu, záľuby a vzdelávanie, skrátka pre kvalitnejší život. Firmy na to majú, ale nechcú sa svojich výsad vzdať. Pracujúci však majú nárok na viac. Práve pre takých vzniklo hnutie Socialisti.sk. Téma skracovania pracovného času sa stáva kľúčovou témou autentickej ľavice všade v Európe. Staňte sa súčasťou hnutia, ktoré znamená budúcnosť.

Sanna Marin (2019):
“I believe people deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture,” she had previously said at her party's conference in the autumn of 2019.

“This could be the next step for us in working life.”

An attempt by former French prime minister Lionel Jospin to bring in a 35-hour workweek at the beginning of the 21st century produced only limited success, with many loopholes and low uptake.

Ahead of last year’s general election, the UK’s Labour Party said it wanted to work towards a four-day week as a long-term aim within a decade, though the party remains in opposition.

Some local councils in Finland’s neighbour Sweden have been experimenting with six-hour days in recent years, with early results suggesting the move increased productivity. 

Finland has one of the highest levels of trade union coverage in Europe, with 91 per cent of employees covered by collective agreements guaranteeing working time, pay and conditions.

The Social Democratic Party leader, who heads a five-party coalition all led by women, was inspired by neighbouring Sweden, which adopted the six-hour day in 2015.

Early results appear to show that employees were happier, wealthier and more productive, as they were still fully paid and customers were more satisfied.

But Stuart says it's the improvement in staff morale, which has helped to recruit and retain willing workers, which has been the biggest positive.

The international debate on working models stoked again recently with Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, who co-founded web retail giant Alibaba, again pushing his so-called 996 system: six days of 9am to 9pm working, adding up to a 72 working week.

That compares with 37 in Denmark and 39 in many countries, including Holland, France, Ireland, Italy and Sweden.

What is the productivity gap?

While we work more than most as a nation, Britain lags behind the world's leading economies in labour productivity, including our international neighbours.

Some four-day week campaigners point to Parkinson’s law, which claims work expands to fill the time available for its completion, as an explanation of how workers in Britain effectively waste a day a week.

Calls for a four-day switch increased after a New Zealand financial services company initiated the four-day-week and claimed it boosted productivity by 24%.

Yet the world of business remains largely sceptical of the benefits of losing a working day to enhance output, with high-profile examples of US tech companies reverting back to a five-day week refuelled arguments that it remains the only practical way of modern working.

Ian Brinkley, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), recently said there was no "particularly strong evidence" that reducing working time automatically improves productivity.

But some businesses have made time for a four-day week and sustained the number of hours at the same time.

"(But) if the money wasn't going to be the same I don't think I could do it, as I'm saving for a house."

She says she's "not sure every business can do this" but says for the more "extreme" long-hour industries "it's more important".

People used the additional day off for some of the same leisure activity they would have done at the weekend, such as golf or watching Netflix, but new activities emerged too, according to Jarrod Haar, a professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology.

He said significantly lower job stress and burnout was reported, with work-life balance levels achieving record highs.

Even though the standard hours worked in a week have been lowered to 35, many occupations demand much more. 


Even business mogul Richard Branson supports the shift to a shorter work week, stating in a blog post:

    By working more efficiently, there is no reason why people can't work less hours and be equally—if not more—effective. People will need to be paid more for working less time, so they can afford more leisure time. That's going to be a difficult balancing act to get right, but it can be done.


Marin first discussed the idea during a panel debate at the Social Democratic Party’s 120th anniversary event last summer, where speakers took stock of the movement’s achievements -- including the eight-hour work day -- and envisioned future causes. The political movement has struggled to find relevance among younger voters, as pensioners become a more dominant group among its base of supporters.

Painting in broad strokes to describe a future in which a Social Democratic welfare state becomes carbon neutral and equitable, Marin envisioned “Utopian” scenarios.

“A four-day work week, a six-hour workday, why couldn’t that be the next step? Is eight hours the final truth?” Marin asked on Aug. 17. “I think people deserve more time with their families, hobbies, life. This could be the next step for us in working life.”

Finns work on average about 40 hours over a five-day work week, according to the statistics office, but unemployment remains high and many have fallen outside the work force. That’s prompted a broad debate on work in Finland in recent years, including the first nationwide experiment on a form of basic income run by the previous center-right government in 2016-2018.

Marin’s Social Democrats rule together with four other parties on the left and center of the political spectrum.
