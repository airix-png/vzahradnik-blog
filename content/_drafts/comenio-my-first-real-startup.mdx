I never planned to be an entrepreneur, but I was always close to them. My mom and all my aunts work as small entrepreneurs for years; they operate an accounting firm, a travel agency, or make desserts for a living. Without even knowing, I observed them and learned fundamental principles how small businesses operate. Still, I decided to pursue my career as an employee. However, as years went by, it was clear to me that being an employee was not a wise decision for me. I'm a creative person and I hate boundaries that come from my job description. In late 2018, I finally decided to step into a void and pursue my career as a freelancer and an entrepreneur. After one year, I can tell you this — I will never look back; an absolute freedom — to do whatever I want, whenever I want — is a bliss for me. Entrepreneurship comes with downsides too, especially not a stable income; however, if you have guts to live with uncertainty, you will be okay.

## A startup — the most difficult game I know
As many of my peers, I played computer games. Unlike them, however, I grew out of it. To this day, I occassionally play retro games or their remasters; the Monkey Island Saga and the Broken Sword Series are my most beloved ones. What I realized is that playing a game is great and you feel good doing it, but it eventually ends. Also, your achievements in a game mean almost nothing in the real world. It's just one of many things to share on your social pages, nothing more. Lets keep aside professional gamers and streamers; they are a minority.

> Being an entrepreneur is like playing the most difficult PC game of all times. It never ends and the level you achieve is purely in your hands.

I take my entrepreneurship as a game; I never came to a better analogy. I play as "myself" and I keep trying to build something useful out of nothing — no financial resources, lack of skills, lots of competitors. If I fail, I analyze what happened and try to do better next time. And yes, there always will be a next time. It's something people like me have in common; they try again and again, no matter what. And I love having friends who are like this.

## Concertino, a startup which stayed on paper
My first startup was called Concertino and it was back in 2015. It supposed to aggregate all music events in my neighborhood and notify me whenever my favorite band or artist had a concert near me. I prepared a list of features, thought about architecture, even learned how to scrape data out of web. However, as I found out after a year of working on it during nights, I had almost nothing. When I look back, I know exactly what was the problem. I was the only one working on my product. As a developer, I thought that I need no one to help me; and instead searching for other co-founders, I kept working. However, there was so much to do!

> In this day and age, it's almost impossible to build a successful product alone. However, with a team of skilled people you stand a chance!

## Your professional network is key
When Concertino failed, I wasn't committed to start with something else right away. My biggest problem was that my professional network included mostly recruiters and my former colleagues; and I had no idea how to do the "networking" and grow my network with acquaintances, which can help me. Also, I didn't know how to build a team — actually, I still don't know that, but at least now I have finally someone I can ask about how to tackle this problem. Also, I had no skills with leading people and I had no experience with giving public talks, which are vital to build the awareness of your brand or product.

I decided to approach my problem systematically. I searched for public speaking clubs in my area and became a member in one of them. If you think that you only get better at public speaking there, you're wrong. You deal with other members, recruit others; you constantly try to pitch your club to potential new members and you network a lot! Also, I was soon elected to be one of club's officers and had a small non-profit organization to run. All in all; valuable skills.

> Lack of presentation skills is apparent for many founders in my region.

I kept an eye on the startup ecosystem in my area and abroad. Albeit not being part of it, I constantly read about the achievements of others. Startups became my hobby. One thing was certain for me — I knew that I want to find a niche market for my startup; I had no plans competing with dozens of startups building similar products for wide customer base which try acquire customers by telling them to stop using product A and to use theirs instead. I am well avare of the power of niche market; you solve an actual problems for a very specific group. Oftentimes, you're the first one to tackle the problem or you may have one or two competitors. Still, the chance to survive first year is, in my opinion, higher and you don't necessarily burn your money.

While I had no idea, what will be my next product, I knew that one of the most effective ways to build your professional network is to put some content out there. I started blogging and for the first time I thought about YouTube. As I had no experience with video production, or content creation whatsoever, I skimmed through countless of YouTube channels for the topic. And I found Think Media. It's a channel that helps aspiring content creators with their humble beginnings. As I soon found out, its founder, Sean Cannel, is a co-author of a book called "YouTube Secrets", a bestseller in the category on Amazon. Little did I know that Sean will open a whole new path for me. I registered myself in his mailing list and when he offered a free webinar, I decided to attend.

## Building your digital product
His webinar was not recorded; he tried to keep the participants focused by forcing them to take notes. In one hour he told us surprising behind-the-scenes facts behind his success. As it turned out, YouTube income is only a fraction of what he earns; the majority of his income comes from digital courses and online workshops. According to him, everyone can build a product to sell. Everyone has a unique story or skill to make side income out of it.

I thought about building a digital course for Udemy before. I have deep technical knowledge in many software topics, and I am sure that there is a customer base for my courses. However, Udemy wasn't for me out of two reasons:
- If a user finds your course through Udemy Ads, they will keep half of your profit
- If you have your courses in a big marketplace like Udemy, the fact that an user finds potentially several courses like yours keeps the price low. If your course would sell for $100 and your competitor with decent reviews would sell it for $50, I bet the majority of users would pay him. Ultimately, many instructors have profits but they are small; not worth the time and effort they put into the course. And if your course in a very specific niche, you won't attract many students and the pay won't cover your personal commitment and time.

Sean, however, suggested something different — build your course on your own website and also do the marketing; all without an intermediary like Udemy. You need to try harder, but profit and potential earnings is magnitudes higher. For example, his course to build an successful YouTube channel costs about $700, and yet he sells it successfully. Even I bought one, and it is a lot of money for me. Can you imagine selling a $700 course in Udemy? I bet no one would buy it there!

His webinar provided valuable insights and I had to process a lot of new information. As I thought on building my first course, on my website, suddenly it clicked to me. I need a platform to host the content. A platform hidden away from the user, which hosts all my courses, provides insights on my students, integrates payment processors and is able to host a simple webpage on a custom domain. Sean Cannel has it already — as it turned out, he uses Kajabi, a platform which costs $200 per month. He is happily paying for it, as his profit is higher than the monthly cost of this platform. However, for me it is a lot of money, considering no or small income for a long time — I'm not yet in a position to market my courses, maybe I can attract few people but the costs of operation are higher.

## Kajabi and the alternatives
As it turned out, this market is niche. There are countless of platforms offering digital courses in a manner like Coursera, but almost no platform like Kajabi, which provides services for individual instructors who want to handle things on their own. And yet, this market is very promissing considering the trends of content creation. I was able to find one viable alternative called Podia. They offer in-par functionality to Kajabi and costs about $50 per month. Yet, it's a lot of money. Then it hit me — I spent countless of hours on the edX platform learning many useful skills. The edX platform is open-source — would it be possible to take the code, and run it in isolation so that each instructor has his own instance where he can provide his courses and manage his students? Building an e-learning platform based on edX seemed to me a very interesting opportunity. I knew the demand for such a service will be growing and I knew that the market, albeit niche, is big enough to generate decent earnings even if I take only a fraction of the market.
